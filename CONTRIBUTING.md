### Missing a feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a
proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone, as
we have our own goals for the project. Please consider what kind of change
it is:

- For a **major feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so
  that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our
  efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so
  that it is successfully accepted into the project.

- **Small features and bugs** can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull
  Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into
  the `main`, as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the
  overall functionality of the project.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for
your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds
readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we
need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will
systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the
custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template.

Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal
reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue.

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You
don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR,
go ahead.

1. **Development**: Fork the project, set up the development environment,
   by installing [EditorConfig][4] and [luacheck][5] plugins for your editor, make your
   changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to
   your commits.

2. **Build**: Before submitting a pull requests, run luacheck and make there
   are no errors. This is a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted.

3. **Pull Request**: After making sure everything passes, commit your changes,
   push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to `Core-Team-META/CC-Template-Repository:main`.
   If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the
   changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR.

After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository.
